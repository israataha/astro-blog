For years, I attended [THAT Conference](https://thatconference.com/) with my coworkers; it was the ultimate team-bonding experience, a chance to kick back and get to know the people I spent 8 hours a day, 5 days a week with on a much deeper level. From dinners and game nights, to rounds of mini golf and late night conversations, we created long lasting memories that would be talked about for years to come. THAT truly delivered on its promise of being a summer camp for geeks.

Despite Clark's advice year after year, when it came to hallway conversations, lunches and post session activities, I stuck with the people I knew rather than sitting at a table with people I didn't know and missed out on countless opportunities to network, meet new people and build those connections. After all I already had my tribe, and it was only after leaving that job and losing that daily connection with what was my only community did Clark's words finally sink in.

So, in January 2024, inspired by the community and conversations around THAT TX, I re-joined Twitter eager to find and build my community. Shortly after that, I heard about [RenderATL](https://www.renderatl.com/), and if there was ever a conference that was going to force me out of my comfort zone, this was going to be it. Before I could overthink my decision, I bought my ticket; there was no backing out now.

Fast forward to June, I made it to Atlanta. I was bubbling with excitement, but as I walked around the AmericasMart building where the conference was being held, I could feel the excitement slowly dissipating. All around me were groups of people huddled together in conversation; not knowing anyone, I felt very much out of place.

In his article [Tech Conferences](https://medium.com/@kelseyhightower/tech-conferences-84d67cf994f6), Kelsey Hightower captured what it felt like, attending my first conference alone:

> I can remember going to conferences alone, hoping to join the party, only to find that conferences can be a bit cliquish, composed of subgroups that roll in tight circles. My first taste of feeling like an outcast came during a conference lunch; I felt like the kid whoâ€™s just transferred to a new school halfway into the school year. I was without my support system, no one knew who I was, and all the cool kids seemed to be having tons of fun without me.

Reading through messages on Render's Discord, it was clear that others were feeling a sense of anxiety and overwhelm. Some of those messages were met with your typical "just talk to people" or "just have fun and network". And while well-intentioned, telling someone with anxiety around large events to "just have fun and network" was like telling someone who's struggling with depression to "just smile and be happy"; it wasn't very helpful.

Here are a few tips that helped me navigate attending my first RenderATL without knowing anyone.

## Join the Conversation Online

I started by connecting with people on social media ahead of time. Whether it's Twitter, LinkedIn, Slack or Discord, a lot of conferences have a social media presence. Follow the conference page or relevant hashtags, join the Slack workspaces and Discord servers. More often than not, introducing yourself and being a part of the conversation can be a little less intimidating online. You'll find yourself connecting with other attendees who are planning on attending the same sessions, have similar backgrounds or share the same interests outside of tech.

Because of those online connections, I got the opportunity to join Alexis, Keiana and Domitrius for some amazing tacos at [Tin Lizzy's](https://tinlizzyscantina.com/) on the first day. I also got to meet Aaron, Brandon (co-founder of [Flightcontrol](https://www.flightcontrol.dev/)) and Austin over pizzas at Mellow Mushroom on the last day.

So leverage social media to join conversation online, and don't be afraid to make plans with internet strangers, because you never know, they might even become your friends.

## Talk to the Speakers

Did you attend a session that you really enjoyed or found particularly insightful? Do you have questions you wanted to ask the speaker? Most speakers welcome and encourage conversations with attendees after their sessions.

Approaching speakers can be a great way to dive deeper into topics that interest you and to gain valuable insights that weren't covered during the presentation. Speakers often appreciate feedback and are happy to engage in discussions, answer questions, and even provide additional resources.

Donâ€™t be shy about introducing yourself and starting that conversation. Mention what you liked about their session and ask any questions you might have. This can also be a good opportunity to connect with them on a professional level, which can be beneficial for your own growth and networking. I'm grateful that I got to opportunity to meet some truly incredible speakers including Taylor Poindexter, Shaundai Person, Mark 'Techson' Thompson, [James Q Quick](https://www.jamesqquick.com/) and even the legendary [Kelsey Hightower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Hightower).

## Find the Right Networking Events for You

Most conferences offer a variety of networking events and activities organized either by the conference itself or by sponsors. At RenderATL, there were numerous company-sponsored networking events in the evenings.

I made sure to sign up and attend several of those networking events, but for most of them, it was very challenging to have any meanigful conversations with people over the volume of music that was playing through the speakers. I usually left feeling discouraged, like I wasn't able to make the most of those opportunities.

However, not all was lost. I came to find out that sometimes the best networking happens in the most unexpected places, like standing in line to get into the Render Rooftop party, or at workshops that encourage attendee participation. My favorite company sponsored networking event was "Breakfast around the Block", which was hosted by [Block](https://block.xyz/) on the last day of the conference. It offered the right balance of good food, and a casual and quiet environment that lent itself well to having great conversations.

It's worth attending different types of events to help you find the ones that match your preference and comfort level. If you don't enjoy loud, crowded spaces, seek out smaller, more intimate networking events where you can engage in deeper conversations. Finding the right environment can significantly enhance your networking experience and help you build more meaningful connections.

## Take Breaks

Day 2 of RenderATL saw a significant uptick in activity compared to the first day. Sessions were in full swing and the Expo hall housing over 40 vendors and sponsors including Zillow, Slack, GitHub and Sentry to name a few was open and buzzing with activity.

As I walked around trying to take it all in, I felt a sense of anxiety suddenly wash over me. I decided to step away and take a break, so I found a quiet corner to sit down, decompress and recharge.

Conferences can be incredibly stimulating environments. Taking breaks gives you an opportunity to process the information youâ€™ve absorbed, reflect on the conversations youâ€™ve had, and come back recharged and ready for the next round of sessions or networking opportunities.

## It Gets Easier

Attending conferences can be daunting at first, but with each one you attend, you gain a little more experience and with it a little more confidence.

The tech community tends to be a close-knit community, so you're likely to run into a lot of familiar faces, making it easier to start conversations and build on existing relationships. That in itself can provide a sense of comfort, making each subsequent conference feel less intimidating. I've already met a lot of familiar faces at [Chain React](https://chainreactconf.com/) as well as THAT Conference WI this July.

As you expand your circle a little each time, youâ€™ll find that networking gets a little easier. Like any skill, the more you do it, the better you get at it.

Remember to always do what's best and comfortable for you, but try to challenge yourself to step outside of your comfort zone. Be sure to pace yourself, enjoy the experience, celebrate the wins, no matter how small, even if it's just talking to 1 new person, and more importantly, try to "just have fun". ðŸ˜‰
