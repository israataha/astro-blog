              I am a <b><i>full stack software engineer</i></b>, <b><i>conference speaker</i></b>, <b><i>writer</i></b>
              and <b><i>avid baker</i></b>. Fueled by constant curiosity and a passion for learning, I take a
              user-centric approach to problem solving, paying close attention to the details without losing sight of
              the big picture.
            </p>

              I currently work as a Software Architect at Vibrant Credit Union, where I lead the development of <a
                href="https://www.vibrantcoffeehouseandkitchen.com/">Vibrant Coffeehouse & Kitchen</a
              >'s new mobile app using React Native, .NET/C#, PostgreSQL and Azure. Read more about it <a href="/work"

              When I'm not behind the computer, I'm usually spending quality time with my family, going on walks, and
              geocaching adventures with my kids. We also love watching movies and shows together; our current favorite
              is The Amazing Race. We also enjoy traveling across the US and internationally. Some of my favorite
              destinations have been Spain and Japan, both of which have left me with unforgettable memories.
